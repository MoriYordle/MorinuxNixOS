The Boxes package is missing, from the official repos, to install it you need to install it through flatpak, to do this after you edit the configuration.nix file to fit your pc and rebuild the system, you would need to input the following commands on Konsole

# This adds the flatpak repos to the system, they are needed to install flatpaks
```
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

# This installs Boxes, which is a hypervisor like VirtualBox or VMWare Player
```
flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Boxes
```

Restart the system and the program should be installed. You only need to restart it once, after that what ever flatpak you install will appear in the app drawer
